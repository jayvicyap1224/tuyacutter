# If this script exists, it is called before the local safety checks, including checking 
# if there are local services running on required ports.

# This example forcebily shuts down systemd-resolved, and keeps it down, removing the
# need to prompt the user to shut it down while running. 
# Note if using this script, you will need to manually enable systemd-resolved.service
# after the device has been flashed.
# sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
